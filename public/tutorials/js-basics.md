# JavaScript Basics

Welcome to your first JavaScript tutorial! In this lesson, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript programming.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that powers the dynamic behavior of websites. It allows you to create interactive web applications, modify webpage content, and respond to user actions.

## Your First Program

Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program. Type the following code in the editor:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Click the "Run" button to see the output. You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the console.

## Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Modify the code to print your name instead of "Hello, World!".
